# Include

This directory contains all header files (`.hpp`) for the project.

## Organization

- Headers should be organized in subdirectories based on functionality
- Public headers should be clearly separated from internal headers
- Use include guards or `#pragma once` consistently throughout the project

## Guidelines

1. Keep header files minimal and focused
2. Avoid including implementation details in headers
3. Use forward declarations when possible to minimize include dependencies
4. Document public interfaces thoroughly
5. Consider using namespace organization for larger projects

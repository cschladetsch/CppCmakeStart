# Source Files

This directory contains the implementation files (`.cpp`) for the project.

## File Organization

- Core functionality should be organized into logical subdirectories
- Each source file should have a corresponding header file in the `include/` directory
- Implementation files should follow the naming convention established in the include directory

## Guidelines

1. Keep implementation files focused and single-purpose
2. Follow the project's coding standards
3. Document complex algorithms and non-obvious implementations
4. Include appropriate error handling and logging
